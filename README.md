# Procrast-A-Nation!
I wanted to create a game website to provide some amusement and distraction for people who suffer from stress and bordom in their busy lives. I beleive it is sometimes easier to focus on the important work/studies if you acknowledge that some fun is necessary and create time and space to indulge in a bit of procrastination.
All human beings can procratinate, therefore I decided to call my website a play on that word and the nation: Procrast-A-Nation.

## User stories

- #### Site user goals
    1. As a site user, I want to navigate the site easily and understand what the site is offering.
    2. As a site user, I want to be entertained by the games on offer, they should be fully interactive and I should be able to see how I am doing at all times, as well as being told if I win or lose.
    3. As a site user, I want to be able to increase the difficulty of the game or make it more challanging by the use of levels or something.

- #### Site owner goals
    1. As a site owner, I want to provide a clear website that is easy to navigate and read all text/info, with no distractions or broken links etc.
    2. As a site owner, I want the games to be fun to play, but quite simple. I want the user to feel challenged but not frustrated.
    3. As a site owner, I want the games to be interactive and to provide feedback to the user. I want the difficulty to increase with the inclusion of a level 2, with the view to creating more games and more levels in the future.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used are blue and white, as these complement each other nicely. I also feel that blue is a calm and relaxed colour and thats the feel I want to encourage in the website; that this is a place to chill and not worry about time or work. I used a background image with a pattern as I feel that is more interesting than a plain coloured background. However, I chose a pattern that isnt 'busy' so as not to be distractng to the eye when playing the games.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Roberto Condensed font is used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roberto Condensed is easy to read, attractive and appropriate to the asthetic of the site. The font colour throughout is white to make it stand-out and for ease of reading against the background.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   I created the site logo using Adobe Photoshop and a stockphoto located online that I edited to suit my purpose. The images for the cards had to fit each theme, Marvel Characters for level 1 and travel pictures for level 2. The images had to be re-sized to be uniform and fit in the game-grid, they also had to be clear and of good quality so that the users were able to match them properly. 

## Wireframes page designs:

## Features

-   Responsive on all device sizes.

-   Interactive memory card game, with more than 1 level.

-   Home-page: This page is the landing page when you visit the site, so it needed to be clear about what the website was about. There are clear option buttons which allows the user to navigate the site easily.

-   Memory Card Level 1: this page is the first level of the memory card game, so there is an explanation of what a memory card game is and the rules/theme for level 1. The game grid then sits below this (with 12 cards, 6 pairs) and the game timer starts when the first card is clicked as per the explanation. The score/moves/time is shown so the user can be aware of their progress the whole game. They can then play again, move to the next level or return to the main menu page.

-   Memory Card Level 1: this page is the second level of the memory card game. It also has the explanation of the memory card game and the rules/theme for level 2. The game grid and score/time box are in the same position but the game grid contains 4 more cards to make 8 total pairs, to increase the difficulty with the same time limit as level 1.

### Future Features
-   I would like to create and add more games using vanilla JavaScript, which is why I left a 'more games coming soon button' to let the users know that if they liked this site to keep coming back to see what new games will be added in the future. I did follow a online tutorial to create a 'Snake' game using JavaScript, however I didn't think it was necessary to add that to this website currently as I am not advanced enough yet to develop the basic game idea further and customize it. But in the future games like 'Snake' and 'Naughts & Crosses' could be added to the games inventory for this site.

## Technologies Used

-   In this project I used [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5), [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). 

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

-   I also made use of the [Bootstrap framework library](https://getbootstrap.com/).
-   [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/) Google fonts were used to import the 'Roberto Condensed' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.
-   [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/) Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.
-   [GitHub:](https://github.com/) GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.
-   [Git:](https://git-scm.com/) Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
-   [Responsinator:](http://www.responsinator.com/) Responsinator was used to check the site was responsive across all devices.
-   [Balsamiq:](https://balsamiq.com/) Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process.
-   [Autoprefixer CSS online](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) Autoprefixer was used to get the correct web extensions like -webkit- added to my CSS so that it worked on IOs systems.
-   Chrome, Microsoft Edge & Firefox internet browsers.
-   Adobe Photoshop, for the logo.


## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

JSHint was used to check there were no errors or potential problems in the JavaScript code.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and FireFox browsers to check it loaded correctly.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop and a variety of iPhones & Android phones to check it loaded correctly.
-   The website was tested on Responsinator to ensure responsiveness on all devices.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly. This was done by frequently moving from one page by clicking the button links for all pages on all devices.
-   A large amount of testing of the game functions was completed during developement. After every change the game was tested to ensure no new issues or bugs were located.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues, they reported a success on all fronts.

Problems that needed to be overcome:

- Matching the cards - used frameworks to name each card image and created code that checked the frame work names to know if the cards matched or not.
- The game timer function triggering with the first click only and not every time a card was clicked. Overcame with 'var firstClick = false' in app.js.
- The board needed to be locked after clicking on the 2 cards to be 'flipped' or else a user could keep 'flipping' the cards before the match function could be executed, which is why a lockBoard variable was needed. Also needed to create a 'disableAllCards' funtion for when the game is won or lost so the user cant keep playing and needs to select to play again or a new level.
- With the addition of a Level 2 the 'const cards' variable wasnt triggering for the level 2 cards, to overcome this a 'cards2' was created and another event listener. Another level 2 issues was that the number of pairs needed to completed the game had to be increased from 6 to 8, so a level1 or level2 ID was given and these targeted using 'getAttribute('id')' and 'levelOneMatches' and 'levelTwoMatches' variables created.
- Issues with the site working on IOS mobile devices as the CSS wasnt loading correctly for the game, the cards wouldnt 'flip' correctly. Solved this by running the appropriate CSS through 'Autoprefixer' (as linked to above) and adding the webkit options to the code for IOS software.

## Future maintainability

The images used are stored in the assests/images folder for easy maintainability, the memory card game images are also divided into their own separate folder so it is clear which image relates to what. It will be simple to swap out or update pictures and the image locations in the HTML are clear.

There is clear code commenting for each section of the HTML pages, which make it easy for developers to view for future maintenence. It makes changing the code/updating the details easier for other developers.

There is also clear code commenting in the CSS & JavaScript sections. Each section is clearly labled to ensure if any bugs or errors do occur it will be simple to see what part of the page each CSS and JavaScript section affects. This makes updating and changing the CSS and JS effects easier for other developers.

### Content

Online tutorials:

- The initial game design and the CSS 'flip' animation, with the backface/frontface images, was taken from viewing the tutorial by Youtube user [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZniVgo8U7ek&t=330s). However during the middle of the project mentor session, we refractored and simplified alot of the JavaScript code from this video so it doesnt match this exactly anymore, but the basic game did grow from this source.

- The Function time() was taken from this online video created by Youtube user [codeTonight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrTCHHhoUQU)

- I took some inspiration from these guides also; first by [Sandra Israel-Ovirih](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-build-a-memory-matching-game-in-javascript) and the second, also based on the first, by [Michelle Aniuchi](https://aadaobi.medium.com/building-a-memory-matching-game-in-javascript-48e792c7b563).

### Media

I created the logo for the site using Adobe Photoshop.

The 'bee happy' slogan was taken from [Google images](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F630785491557264850%2F&psig=AOvVaw1PJlhki4Q-ZaiB_eyynMaH&ust=1612361458061000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCPCwtNewy-4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD) and the colour changed using 'Paint 3D' to suit the site.

The images for the background and the Memory card game levels used in this site were obtained from Google/images.
